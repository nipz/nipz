I go by many names; whichever one you know me by, you're in the right place! I am a product manager focused on decentralized technologies. I've been using GitHub to host my repos for many years, and I am now rekindling my love to code, and my current focus is solidity. I have a background in IT solutions and believe in agile software development.
